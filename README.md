# angular-demo

This repo follows the angular sample store project (https://angular.io/start) to build a frontend web shop with shopping cart including new css updates and deployed on firebase.

This ficticious shop sells boogies and has a async fetch for shipping rates.  No payment gateway has been added.

You can see the deployed project here: https://g-boogie-shop.web.app/ 

I found the angular file structure to be very intuitive and easy to use so far in this simple app.
